Chaos and Automaton are both based on elementary cellular automata. Their RULE is determined by their 8 inputs (as a binary number, MSB being the bottom input.) Next generation is produced when a gate signal is received over the STEP inputs. Chaos allows you to mess with its current generation via its TRIG inputs. SCAN affects how the binary number (output through the VALUE outputs) is generated, negative SCAN (red light) means MSB is on top and positive SCAN (green light) means MSB is at the bottom of the module (the defult.) You can also tinker with SCAN, STEP and the cells themselves by clicking on them.
