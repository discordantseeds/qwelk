Chaos and Automaton are both based on [elementary cellular automata](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html). Their RULE is determined by their 8 inputs (as a binary number, MSB being the bottommost input.) Next generation is produced when a trigger signal is received over the STEP inputs. Chaos allows you to mess with its current generation via its TRIG inputs which upon receiving trigger (positive) signal have their values set to ON. SCAN affects how the binary number (output through the VALUE outputs) is generated, negative SCAN (red light) means MSb is on top and positive SCAN (green light) means MSB is at the bottom of the module (the defult.) You can also tinker with SCAN, STEP and the cells themselves by clicking on them. 
Consider these modules as 8-bit machines. In order to patch [Rule 30](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=rule+30) into these modules you must first look at the 8-bit binary number representing 30: 00011110 (the MSb is the leftmost digit.) Now, considering the input MSb is located at the bottom of these modules you will need to have positive signals present at the second, third, fourth and the fifth RULE inputs just as, reading from right to left, the second, third, fourth and the fifth bits of the binary word above. Try toggling the cells on and off on the BLUE column manually while providing a clock signal of some sort to the STEP input to see the modules come to life.

The Byte module constructs a binary number out of the patched input signals. The MSb is the bottommost input by default when not patched and switched manually, and once patched the bottommost upon receiving a positive signal and the topmost upon receiving a negative signal. Note that the COUNT module outputs the number of positive signals over the number of _patched_ inputs! i.e. if only one input is patched and the signal present at it is negative, COUNT will output 10v. But if two of the inputs are patched and only one of them has a positive signal present, COUNT will output 5v, as that's (number of positive signals:1 / number of _patched_ inputs:2) * 10.
